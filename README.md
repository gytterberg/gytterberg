  I’m Gabriel, a full stack software developer seeking a challenging, fast paced position with a growing organization. I’m looking for a role where I can learn as much as possible as fast as possible. I’m hungry for hard problems. I bring experience with building elegant and efficient front ends, using JavaScript with React, Material UI, Bootstrap, Angular, Vue.js and others, in addition to my back end skills using Node.js, PostgreSQL and cloud platforms.

  Please check out some of my work! Here is a short list of projects I've worked on:
  
 * [PBNGen](https://github.com/gytterberg/pbngen) - A "paint by numbers" image generator. Upload a photo and convert it to a black and white drawing that you can print out and paint! Uses React, OpenCV computer vision library, and image processing techniques. Originally a 3 day hackathon style project, now fleshed out with more features.
 * [Ytterblog](https://github.com/gytterberg/ytterblog-v2) - A simple blogging app, using React, Redux, Express, Sequelize and PostgreSQL. Content (perpetually) coming soon!
 * [Str8Shot](https://github.com/FSA-Capstone-Team-3/str8shot) - A group project with 3 others exploring geospatial data and mapping, as well as using the Yelp Fusion API.
